=== Scoping Behavior Test Matrix ( 0) ===

This test documents CURRENT BEHAVIOR (Dynamic Scoping)
Results will change after  3 (Lexical Scoping Implementation)

Test 1: Closure capture semantics
  Result:  20
  Current (dynamic): 20
  After  3 (lexical): 10

Test 2: Nested closure capture
  Note: This test demonstrates a LIMITATION of dynamic scoping
  Current (dynamic): ERROR - n is not defined
  After  3 (lexical): 15
  Status: Test skipped (known failure in dynamic mode)

Test 3: Mutual recursion
  Result:  [Void]
  Current (dynamic): 1
  After  3 (lexical): 1
  Note: Works in both modes (top-level bindings)

Test 4: Map with closure (free variable)
  Result:  [List: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
  Current (dynamic):  [List: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
  After  3 (lexical): (3 6 9 12 15)
  Note: Works in both modes (multiplier in parent scope)

Test 5: Variable shadowing
  Result:  200
  Current (dynamic): 200
  After  3 (lexical): 100 (if inner5 defined before shadow)

Test 6: Scope isolation
  Result:  100
  global_var accessible: yes
  local_var accessible outside: no
  Note: Local scope isolation works in both modes

Summary:
  - Test 1: WILL CHANGE (20 -> 10)
  - Test 2: WILL START WORKING (currently fails)
  - Test 3: NO CHANGE (works in both)
  - Test 4: NO CHANGE (works in both)
  - Test 5: WILL CHANGE (depends on definition order)
  - Test 6: NO CHANGE (isolation works in both)
